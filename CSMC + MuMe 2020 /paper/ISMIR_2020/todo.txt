Introduction of assisted orchestration
State of the art is Orchidea
Try deep learning methods
Explain that we trained a classifier to use for orchestration
3 types of classification

Baseline with tables
Document how we generated the data
Justify the models

Explain the porblem we have
Explain the models
	Baseline
	CNN
	ResNet
Say what we did with the model and draw conclusions

Evaluation is done on orchestration, not classification
Two tables : classification results and orchestration results

For classification

To compute distance, compute FFT on samples of generated orchestration, and then apply the distance using abs value of FFT



Plot what helped to take the decisions
If the model is a non standard model, we would need a diagram
Latent space of the CNN

Table saying classification for each instrument given different N




















Add as many references as we can (almost for every sentence)
Give the essential for the references, formatting can be done later
Look for the most cited paper, most accepted
Introduction should be two columns, explain more in detail the goal and why we framed that as a 

{Inspected by Carmine}
Interpretation of same instruments :
	1. Amount of data (is it consistent accross instrument)
	2. Nature of the instrument (too complex or too simple)
	3. Transience : Flute is basically noise, and FFT doesn't handle that well (same level acrosss frequencies)

we think this would be the reason but further work would be needed

latent space, especially the two last convolutional layers, and see what lstm does to the batch of data

put the 5 authors

We didn't do better than state of the art but we got consistent results
