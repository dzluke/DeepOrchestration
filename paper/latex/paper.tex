\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\section{Our model}

\subsection{Baseline}
In order to have a baseline to compare our results against, we attempted to solve the classification problem using various linear classifiers. The classifiers we tested were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). We used the implementations provided in the scikit-learn library for each classifier. For SVM, we used SVC with an RBF kernel. For RF, we set the maximum depth of each tree to be 15. Each classifier was wrapped in a MultiOutputClassifier to achieve the multi-label nature of this problem. We found SVM to have the highest accuracy of the three classifiers across all experiments.

We started by simplifying the problem to classifying only the instruments and not the pitch. This had the benefit of both reducing the number of classes and increasing the number of samples per class.

\section{Citations}

All bibliographical references should be listed at the end,
inside a section named ``REFERENCES,'' numbered and in alphabetical order.
All references listed should be cited in the text.
When referring to a document, type the number in square brackets
\cite{Author:00}, or for a range \cite{Author:00,Someone:10,Someone:04}.

When the following words appear in the conference publication titles, please abbreviate them: Proceedings $\rightarrow$ Proc.; Record $\rightarrow$ Rec.; Symposium $\rightarrow$ Symp.; Technical Digest $\rightarrow$ Tech. Dig.; Technical Paper $\rightarrow$ Tech. Paper; First $\rightarrow$ 1st; Second $\rightarrow$ 2nd; Third $\rightarrow$ 3rd; Fourth/nth $\rightarrow$ 4th/nth.

\textcolor{red}{As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of \cite{Someone:10},'' not ``In our previous work \cite{Someone:10}.'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available (e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A. Anonymous.''}
