	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item what is CAO 
		\item why we need source separation 
		\item which type of sounds are useful for us (targets)
	\end{itemize}		
	
	\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}
	We compare a number of source separation methods and our metrics depend on the orchestration
	Distance metric and formula here
	
	\section{Experiments}\label{sec:experiments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Full orchestration
		\item Ground truth
		\item NMF
		\item 4 neural models: TDCNN++, TDCNN, Demucs, OpenUnmix
		\item table with results
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
	We think that adding source separation improves orchestration. Unsupervised methods work better because of the data that supervised methods are trained on \cite{Someone:00}
	
	\section{Future Work}\label{sec:futurework}
	Implementing these methods in Orchidea. We could improve the supervised methods by training them ourselves with data that fits our problem better.
