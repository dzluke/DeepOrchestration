It was started in 2005 and it is being maintained to support diverse research projects and as a service to the overall research and artistic community.

In this demo we want to introduce Freesound to the multimedia community and show its potential as a research resource. We begin by describing some general aspects of Freesound, its architecture and functionalities, and then explain potential usages that this framework has for research applications.},
