# Deep learning approaches on musical assisted-orchestration: an evaluation study

C. E. Cella, Luke, Alejandro, Hong Fu, Hélène-Camille Crayencour


## Introduction
- what is assisted orchestration, history and previous results
- state-of-the-art systems (Orchidea)

## Our model
- deep learning trained for classification and then used for orchestraion
- changing number of instruments
### Baseline
- SVM, RF, ....

### CNN + LSTM

### ResNet

- SVM was good but CNN was better and ResNet was best
- review all experiments we did and choose key plots

## Orchestration experiments
- set of 10 targets
- orchestra fix to 10
- qualitative evaluation: acoustic inspection of the solutions
- quantitative evaluation: distance in feature space
- comparison table between Orchidea and our model

## Evaluation/conclusions
- the approach seems promising for orchestration
- many things used in Orchidea are not implemented here (symbolic constraints, sparsity,...)
- CNN seems better for timbre
- ResNet seems better for pitch (what are timbre and pitch??)
### Interpreting the latent space
- the system finds filters like...

## Future steps
- using conditioning to impose symbolic constraints
- variable size solutions
- joint networks for orchestral size detection and orchestral families (see paper)
